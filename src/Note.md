#### useEffect
- useEffect hook
- accepts two arguments (second optional)
- first argument - cb function
- second argument - dependency array
- by default runs on each render (initial and re-render)
- cb can't return promise (so can't make it async)
- if dependency array empty [ ] runs only on initial render

- Learnt useEffect is not okay with Async function because it returns promise
- Learnt we can invoke async await as function inside of useEffect for data fetching but not at the cb
